redmine_smile_project_enumerations_custom_field_format
=================================================

Redmine plugin that adds new custom field format
That allows to have Enumerations whose values are
set in the project

## How it works

* Tested with Redmine V4.0.0

## TODOs

* Test with other than Issue Custom Field
* Fix Bug enumeration already existing => then redirect
to enumeration not new enumeration (probjem with POST)
* Add tests
* Fix TODOS

```

Enjoy !
